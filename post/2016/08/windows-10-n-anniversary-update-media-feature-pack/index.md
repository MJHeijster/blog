Over the last hour, I've been looking for the correct update for the Anniversary Update. Since Microsoft does not give you the option to, either let it detect which update you need or select on which version you are, I was stuck looking it up.

Eventually I found it. [You can download it here (KB3133719).](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53356)
