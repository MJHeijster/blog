_At the end of 2011, it was estimated that around 20%-25% of all new websites published were built using the WordPress platform. Why wouldn't you try to get the best out of it?_

The following plugins are which I use myself and wouldn't want to do without.

**[Add link to Facebook](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/add-link-to-facebook/):** Facebook is hot, people look at it every day and it helps to have exposure there. There's even an option so that it creates a "share" link. Posting will be a lot slower with this plugin but it is worth it.

 

**[Contact Form 7](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/contact-form-7/):** An easy contact form builder. While a lot of you won't see the need for a contact form, it is very good to have because people might want to contact you about typos, job openings, etc.

 

**[Disqus Comment System:](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disqus-comment-system/)** Disqus is a popular comment system. It is free and has a lot of features like signing in on Disqus, your Google ID, twitter and more. Disqus has a great spam filtering system and it shows. I've not seen spam on my site.

 

**[Easy AdSense](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-adsense-lite/):** I use adsense on my site and through this plugin I can have them in my sidebar, have them at the beginning of the post and the end of the post. It has more options like showing a maximum of 3 ads per page (a limit Google wants enforced) and more.

 

**[Google Plus Author Information in Search Result (GPAISR)](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-author-information-in-search-results-wordpress-plugin/):** Well that actually explains it all. It gives you this in the search result:

**[SEO Ultimate](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-ultimate/):** A great tool to optimize the [SEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) of your website. Also gives extra's like webmaster verification tools, a 404 monitor, slug optimization and more.

 

**[Web Ninja Auto Tagging System](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/web-ninja-auto-tagging-system/):** I hate finding correct tags for my posts. I use this auto tagging system which scans my page and retrieves the best tags for it. It is usually right although I sometimes remove some tags that I do not like.

 

**[WP to Twitter](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-to-twitter/):** Self explains, it automatically sends a tweet when you post something. Has a lot of options like URL shortening, default tweet text, etc.

 

**[Lazy Load](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lazy-load/)**: Lazy Load only loads an image on your website when it is visible. It saves resources and it makes the viewing experience more pleasant be showing the image through a fade-in.

 

[**WP-Piwik**](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-piwik/): Piwik is a great analytics tool. You can read more about Piwik [here](http://www.jeroenheijster.com/ditched-google-analytics/).

 

If you start a new wordpress site it might be nice to check out these plugins. They are all free.

Anything that you use that I should look at? Leave it in the comments.
