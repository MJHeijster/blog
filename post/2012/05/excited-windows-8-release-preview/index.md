In the first week of june, the Release Preview of Windows 8 will be released. I have been running Windows 8 Consumer Preview for a couple of weeks now and I'm actually used to it now. Most of it works like it should, but there are still some issues. For example I use the program MetroTwit for Twitter. The problem is that links open in IE and this isn't something the developers could fix, it is most likely a problem in W8 CP. While most bugs that are currently in W8 CP are small, I would like to see them fixed soon.

It isn't known at the moment what has changed, the changes from Developer Preview to Consumer Preview were big but i don't think this will be the case this time.

So what do you think? Will it be a big step forward? Are you excited? Please, let me know in the comments.
